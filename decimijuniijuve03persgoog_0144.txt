126. Vicit et hoe.- i. e. yet these monstrous acts can bea· no

' compar-ison with the meanness and absurdity of Gracchus, a Ro·

man nobleman, exhibiting himself as a gladiator.

One class of gladiatore was called retiarii .- the retiarius was
dressed in a short tunic (tunicati), but wore nothing on his head
in his left hand he bore a three ointed lance (fuscina or tridens),
and in his ‘25¹¹‘ hand a net (reteZ with which he attempted to en-

If he missed his aim, by either throwing the net too short or too
far, he instantly fied, and endeavored to prepare his net for a
second throw, while his antagonist swiffly pursued, to prevent his
design, by slaying him.

The gladiator, opposed to the retiarius, was called mirmillo,
from μορμύρος a fish, or sequatur, because he pursued the retiarius,
if the latter misned his aim. The mirmillo had the image of a
fish upon his helmet, and was armed‚ like a Gaul, with a buckler
and a hooked sword or cutlass.

the retiarius, from the mimium—Mediam . . . arenam .· ‘ the mid-

132. Esse aliquid: most interpreters understand by this pas-
sage, that the poet proceeds to trace all the forementioned crimes
to their true source, the contempt of religion and disbelief in a
future state of rewards and punishments.—Ruperti understands
it differently, as ridiculing the ancient system of mythology.

133. Centum .- eontue is a long pole or staff, shod with iron at
the bottom‚ to push on small vessels in the water. Juvenal here
alludes to Charon. ’

135. Qui . . . lavantur .· the quadrans, which was made of bras8,
equal in value to about one third osa cent, was paid, by the com-
mon people, to the keeper of the bath. Children, under four
years of age, were either not carried to the baths or nothing was
paid for the privilege of bathing.

136. Tu .· i. e. Gracche, et vos, turpes mollesque homines, accord-
ing to Ruperti.-As others understand it, “ you, who live virtu-
ously.”-—C'uriu.5 .· Curius Dentatus, thrice consul, and remarkable
