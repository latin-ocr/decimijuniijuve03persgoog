SATIRE IV.

Juvenal, in this Satire, indulges his honest indignation against
Crispinus and his employer Domitian.
After describin some of the enormous crimes of Crispinus, the

poet makes a sud en transition to his extravagance and gluttony, ·

and thereby takes occasion to describe a ridiculous consultation,
held by Domitian over a turbot, which was too large to be con-
tained in any dish, that could be found. Aster a long delibera-
tion among the senators, it was proposed, that the fish should be
cut in pieces and thus cooked3 but at'last the opinion of the sen-
ator Montanus prevailed, that it should be dressed whole, and that
a dish, large enough to contain it, should be made expressly for
the purpose of receiving it.

The council is then dismissed, and the Satire concludes with a
most severe censure on the emperor’s cruelty and injustice to·
wards some of the best and most worthy of the Romans.

4. Quid refert .· i. e. what signifies how rich he is, since no bad

nificent porticoes.' It was a part of the Roman luxury to build
{ast pofficoes‘m their gardenS, under which they rode in wet or

were inserted in all law-processes.

13. Quid agas .· this seems to depend upon the lOth verse t
