Umbricius, an Aruspex, and a friend of Juvenal, disgusted at
the prevalence of vice, and total disregard of unassuming virtue,
is introduced on the point of quitting Rome for Cumae. ‘The poet
accompanies him some little way from the city, when the honest
exile, no longer able to suppress his indignation, acquaints him
with the causes of his retirement.

what he says may be arranged under the following head3,—
that Flattery and Vlce are the only thriving arts at Rome 3 that
in these, particularly the first, foreigners have a manifest superi-
ority over the natives, and consequently engross all favor3 ‚that
the poor are universally exposed to scorn and insult3 that the
general habits of extravagance render it difficult for them to s'ub-
sist; and that a crowded capital subjects them to numberless in·
conveniences unknown in the country: he then again adverts to'
the peculiar sufferings of the poorer citizens from the wantos a
well regulated police3 these he illustrates by a variety of exam-
ples, and concludes in a ntrain of pathos and beauty, which winds
up the whole with singular effect. '-
