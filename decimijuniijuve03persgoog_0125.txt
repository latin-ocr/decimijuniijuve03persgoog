THE SATIRES OF JUVENAL

Dncmns J umus J uvarum was born at Aquinum, a town of the
Volsci, about the thirty-eighth (or, more probably, the forty-sec-

having been ordered to repaii· thither, as commander of a compa-

year of his age.

to Satire in preference to any other kind of poetry, to which he
declares he is driven by the vices of the age, of which he gives a
summai-y and general view, Finally, after expressing his indig-
nation, that the liberty of speech, employed by the ancient Sati-
rista, was no longer enjoyed, he makes some bitter reflections on
the danger of satirizing living villany, and professes to treat of
