15. AEquantem . . . libris.- ἰ. e. weigbing six pounds,--it cosi

him a sestertium, a pound.

Three pounds was about the usual weight of this fish, and it
was rarely found larger.

16. Ut perhibent .- as the flatterers of Crispinus give out; they

probably represented the fish to be twice 88 large as it ,really was, ·

as some excuse for his extravagance. .

18. Praecipuam . . . ceram . . . abstulit.- ‘ he had become the
principal heir.’—It was customary for wills to consist of two parts:
the first named the primi haeredes, chief heire, and was therefore
called cera praecipua, because the tablets, on which they wrote,
being of wood, were covered with wax .- the second named the‘
secundi haeredes, lesser heirs, and was called cera secundm—Oth-
ers think that cera means the scal.

19. Ratio nater-im· .· ‘ further reason,’ to excuse his extrava-

ce. >
ἔω210. Latis specularibus .- ‘ with large windows.’—The specularis
lapis was a stone, clear like glasS, cut into small thin panes, and
in 0111 times used for glass. Tho largest panes were of course
the most nearly—Antra .· ⁸ litter—or sedan?

22. Apicius .- a noted glutton in the time of Nero· Even Api·
cius, the poet intimates, was a frug-al 111811 in comparison with
this gormandizer.—Hoc tu .- sc. jecisti—Hoc . . . papyro .- i. e.
you who were formerly brought from Egypt to Rome, a vile slave,
and then clad in papyrus ,- this was a kind of flag, growing on
the banks of the river Nile, of which ropes‚ 111818, 81111 mean cloth-
ing were made.—Or more probably his clothes were tied on him
with cords made of this weed. Sat. Ῑ, 26, 27. ·

24. Squamoe .· this means the scales of fish, but put here by
synecdoche for the fish itself.

25. Provincia . . . vendit .· i. e. the price of this fish would pur·
chase an estate in some of the provinces 3 11111 in Apulia quite an
extensive one.

26. Appulia .- Rupcrti thinks this word should 118 written thus,
as the first syllable of Apulia' is‘short in Hor„ od. 111, 24, 4, 81111
in other passages· Most of the texts, however, have Apulia,
considering the first syllable common. .

28. Endoperatorem .· for imperatorem3 if Crispinus, a court-
buffoon, paid so much for what formed but a small part of a pri·
vate mea] for himself, what must the emperor’s expense be to sat-
isfy his gluttony ‚9—Quum . . . siluros .· quum Crispinus purpureus
scurra mag-ni palati, jam 'nceps equitum (i. e. non magister
equitum, sed inter equitesi ustres relatus), qui solebat, &cn ructtirit
tot sestertia, erig-uam purtem et sumptura de marg-ine modice
coenae.

32. Municipes . . . sauros.- siIuri were fish of small value of
the same country with CrispinuS, i. e. from Egypt—Prieni.-
‘fried—dried—or cured.'
